          Hey! Iâ€™m Ikram, 
           
          </p>
          <p className=" font-medium text-font text-lg pt-4 w-96">
          I was previously an Secondary English Teacher before I stumbled on the tech sphere and have been hooked ever since !

          <p className=" font-medium text-font text-lg pt-4 w-96">
          The enjoyment of web development stems from it's ability to satisfy my innate creativity. Web development allows me to easily 
          communicate ideas into digital form and get results back instantaneously. I can still remember the first time I created an HTML page 
          and opened it in a browser; the thrill and enjoyment that came with it. As a result, I became highly passionate about coding.
          It's certainly not without its ups and downs however, if you love what you do and are able to add value to others, 
          the results are far more rewarding than anything else.

          Coming across The School of Code; its up-to-date curriculum, constant support, and accessibility unleashed contentment, motivation, and hope in my future and passion.
