          Hey!, I’m Ikram, I am a 23 year old former English Secondary Teacher.
           
          </p>
          <p className=" font-medium text-font text-lg pt-4 w-96">
          Before pursuing a career in tech, I felt fairly stagnant in my teaching career. 
          Despite learning and meeting a lot of great people, I just wasn’t fully satisfied. 
           
        
          </p>
          <p className=" font-medium text-font text-lg pt-4 w-96">
            I have always had an immense enthusiasm for coding, however I believed there was no way of embarking that journey after my degree;
            coming across The School of Code; their up-to-date curriculum, constant support and accessibility unleashed contentment, 
            motivation and hope in my future and passion.
