          The enjoyment of web development stems from it's ability to satisfy my innate creativity. Web development allows me to easily 
          communicate ideas into digital form and get results back instantaneously. I can still remember the first time I created an HTML page 
          and opened it in a browser; the thrill and enjoyment that came with it. As a result, I became highly passionate about coding 
          and have continued to be so ever since. It's certainly not without its ups and downs however, if you love what you do and are able 
          to add value to others, the results are far more rewarding than anything else

            I have always enjoyed the sanctity of coding, it's been infiltrating and ambivent. I have enjoyed the front-end side of creating 
            code, most importantly the dom selector
